NAME
	cb_irand - generates an array of random bits

SYNOPSIS

	C/C++:

	#include &lt;<a href="cbl.html">cbl.h</a>>
	void cb_irand(long *array, long n);

IMPLEMENTATION

	Version 1.0 for 32/64-bit big/little endian unix platforms.

DESCRIPTION

	cb_irand generates an array of 32/64-bit words with random bit
	patterns in each word. For each word of output, 2/4 random
	values are obtained from the system random number generator.
	For a 32-bit word, bits 10-25 are extracted from the 1st value
	and are used for bits 0-15 of the word, and bits 11-26 from the
	2nd value are used for bits 16-31 of the word. For a 64-bit
	word, bits 12-27 from the 3rd value are used for bits 32-47, and
	bits 13-28 from the 4th value are used for bits 48-63. 

	array	(output) returned array of 32/64-bit word of random bits.

	n	(input) the number of elements in array to be filled
		with random bits.

NOTES
	Internally cb_irand uses rand(). The seed value, and hence the
	sequence of values, can be modified with srand().
