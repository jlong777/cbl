NAME
	cb_copy_bits - Copy contiguous sequence of memory bits

SYNOPSIS

	C/C++:

	#include &lt;<a href="cbl.html">cbl.h</a>>
	void cb_copy_bits(long *dest, long doffset,
	                  long *src,  long soffset,
			  long nbits);

IMPLEMENTATION

	Version 1.0 for 32/64-bit big/little endian unix platforms.

DESCRIPTION

	cb_copy_bits copies a sequence of bits from one region of memory
	to another region of memory. The source and destination regions
	should not overlap. The starting location for each region may be
	on an arbitrary bit within a memory word.

	dest	(output) base address of the destination memory array.

	doffset	(input) offset in bits from the beginning of dest where
		the destination of the copy actually begins. doffset
		must be zero or positive and may be larger than 64.

	src	(input) base address of the source memory array.

	soffset	(input) offset in bits from the beginnig of src where
		the source bits of the copy actually begin. soffset
		must be zero or positive and may be larger than 64.

	nbits	(input) number of bits to be copied.


NOTES

	cb_copy_bits is optimized for copying large blocks of unaligned
	memory.

	The bcopy routine is an alternative to cb_copy_bits for C
	programmers if the source and destination regions are aligned
	on byte boundaries and the number of bits copied is a multiple
	of 8. cb_copy_bits is slightly faster, but bcopy does not have
	the restriction of non-overlapping regions.

	cb_copy_bits is single-threaded (i.e. not tasked) and may be
	called from within a parallel region.
