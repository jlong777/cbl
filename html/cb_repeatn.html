NAME
	cb_repeatn - find short tandem repeats in a nucleotide string

SYNOPSIS

	C/C++:

	#include &lt;<a href="cbl.html">cbl.h</a>>
	void cb_repeatn(long *db, long dblen, long repeat_len,
			long min_repeats, long *pattern,
			long *location, long *num_found);

IMPLEMENTATION

	Version 1.0 for 32/64-bit big/little endian unix platforms.

DESCRIPTION

	cb_repeatn finds regions of a nucleotide string that contain
	a short pattern of nucleotides repeated consecutively in the
	region. For each nucleotide starting location, N, in db
	between the beginning of db and repeat_len*min_repeats locations
	from the end of db, repeat_len nucleotides in db are replicated
	min_repeats times and compared to the the original nucleotide
	sequence. If there is an exact match, the current pattern becomes
	a candidate. The candidate is checked to determine if it itself is
	a repeat sequence. For example, if repeat_len is 6 and the
	candidate is ATATAT, the candidate is itself a repeat of a length
	2 pattern. If the candidate is an overlay of a smaller size repeat,
	the candidate is rejected. The list of recent patterns is checked
	to be sure that the candidate is not the tail end of an already
	recorded pattern. For example, if at position N=100 the sequence
	is ACTACTACTACTACTACTACTACT, and repeat_len = 3, a pattern with 8
	repeats of ACT is recorded. The candidate of 7 repeats starting at
	location N=103 is rejected. If the candidate survives these filters,
	then the actual number of times it is repeated is computed. This
	value, count, is placed in the lower 30 bits of the next free
	location of the pattern array. The actual repeated nucleotide
	pattern is placed in bits 30-61 of the same word, and the pattern
	is left justified in this field. The starting location, N, is
	placed in the corresponding element of the location array.

	db		input nucleotide data for database string, packed
			using 2-bit compression (see cb_compress, mode=2).

	dblen		input number of nucleotides packed into db.

	repeat_len	input length, in number of nucleotides, of repeat
		   	pattern.

	min_repeats	input minimum number of times the pattern must be
			repeated to qualify as a find.

	pattern		output array of packed words containing the
			repeated pattern and the number of times it was
			repeated, in this format:

 			------------------------------------------
 			|00| pattern (32 bits) | count (30 bits) |
 			------------------------------------------

			The memory for pattern must be allocated before
			calling cb_repeatn.

	location	output array of starting locations in db for
			repeated patterns in the corresponding locations
			of the pattern array. The first location of db is
			number 1. The memory for location must be
			allocated before calling cb_repeatn.

	num_found	on input - size of pattern and location arrays.
			on output - number of valid entries in the pattern
			array. If the number of patterns found is larger
			than the size of the pattern array, num_found is
			returned as -(number found before overflow), and
			the remainder of db is not searched. Three error
			conditions cause the special value of -1 to be
			returned. See the NOTES below.

NOTES

	cb_repeatn assumes the following conditions:

	repeat_len is in the range 2..16

	num_found > 0 on entry

	dblen > repeat_len*min_repeats

	If any of the three conditions is false on entry, num_found
	is set to -1 and no search is done.

	If repeat_len*min_repeats > 32 the internal value for min_repeats
	is reset to 32/repeat_len.

	cb_repeatn is single-threaded (i.e. not tasked) and may be called
	from within a parallel region.
