NAME
	cb_revcompl - Reverse complements compressed nucleotide data.

SYNOPSIS

	C/C++:

	#include &lt;<a href="cbl.html">cbl.h</a>>
	void cb_revcompl(long *db, long *dbrc, long dblen, long mode);

IMPLEMENTATION

	Version 1.0 for 32/64-bit big/little endian unix platforms.

DESCRIPTION

	cb_revcompl reverses the order of the nucleotides in db and
	complements each nucleotide, and stores the result in dbrc.
	The input data is assumed to be stored in compressed form. See
	the man page for <a href="cb_compress.html">cb_compress(3B)</a> for details on nucleotide
	compression. The complement operation changes each nucleotide
	as follows:

	A -> T
	C -> G
	T -> A
	G -> C

	For 4-bit encoded data, additional letters are
	transformed according to these same rules. For
	example,

	R (A or G) -> V (T or C)


	db	(input) nucleotide sequence in either 2-bit or 4-bit
		compressed format. See <a href="cb_compress.html">cb_compress(3B)</a> for details on
		compression. Length of db, in 64-bit words is
		(dblen+31)/32 for mode=2, and (dblen+15)/16 for mode=4.

	dbrc	(output) nucleotide sequence in same compression
		format as db. The result in dbrc is the data from
		db in reverse order, and also each nucleotide is
		complemented. The data in dbrc is shifted so that
		the initial character is left justified in the first
		word of dbrc. Length of dbrc is the same as length
		of db, and dbrc must be allocated by the caller.

	dblen	(input) number of nucleotide codes packed into db.

	mode	(input) allowed values are 2 and 4, and indicates the
		number of bits used to represent each nucleotide
		in the db and dbrc arrays. See the <a href="cb_compress.html">cb_compress(3B)</a>
		man page for a detailed explanation of the compression
		mappings for mode values 2 and 4.

NOTES
	cb_revcompl is single-threaded (i.e. not tasked) and may be called
	from within a parallel region.
