NAME
	cb_compress - Compresses nucleotide or amino acid ASCII data

SYNOPSIS

	C/C++:

	#include &lt;<a href="cbl.html">cbl.h</a>>
	void cb_compress(long *db, long *dbc, long dblen, long mode);


IMPLEMENTATION

	Version 1.0 for 32/64-bit big/little endian unix platforms.

DESCRIPTION

	cb_compress compresses nucleotide or amino acid ASCII data. The
	input array is assumed to be a sequence of upper case or lower
	case ASCII letters (A..Z or a..z). Each letter is translated
	into a code with the number of bits determined by the mode
	parameter. Lower case letters are translated into the same code
	as the corresponding upper case letters. The codes are packed
	into the output array as specified below. A special mode, 6, is
	supplied to convert data packed in 4-bit fields into data
	packed in 2-bit fields.

	db	(input) If mode = 2, 4, or 5, db contains ASCII text,
		packed 8 letters/word. Length of db is (dblen+7)/8
		(64-bit words). if mode = 6, db contains letters packed
		in the 4-bit encoding scheme described below, packed 16
		letters/word. Length of db is (dblen+15)/16
		(64-bit words). The final word may be filled with
		trailing nulls.

	dbc	(output) packed codes. The number of bits/code and the
		amount of memory required depends on the mode value. The
		dbc array must be allocated before calling cb_compress.

	dblen	(input) Number of letters represented in db.

	mode	(input) Allowed values are 2, 4, 5, and 6.

		mode = 2: Each ASCII letter is converted to a 2-bit code
		as follows:

		00 &lt;- A (also H, I, P, Q, X, Y)

		01 &lt;- C (also B, J, K, R, S, Z)

		10 &lt;- T (also D, E, L, M, U)

		11 &lt;- G (also F, N, O, V, W)

		Length of dbc must be >= (dblen+31)/32 (64-bit words).


		mode = 4: Each ASCII letter is converted to a 4-bit code
		as follows:

		1000 &lt;- A
		0100 &lt;- C
		0010 &lt;- G
		0001 &lt;- T, U
		0111 &lt;- B = C or G or T
		1011 &lt;- D = A or G or T
		1101 &lt;- H = A or C or T
		0011 &lt;- K = G or T
		1100 &lt;- M = A or C
		1111 &lt;- N = A or C or G or T
		1010 &lt;- R = A or G
		0110 &lt;- S = C or G
		1110 &lt;- V = A or C or G
		1001 &lt;- W = A or T
		0101 &lt;- Y = C or T
		1111 &lt;- X (same as N)
		1111 &lt;- All other letters

		Length of dbc must be >= (dblen+15)/16 (64-bit words).


		mode = 5: Each ASCII letter is converted to a 5-bit code
		containing the integer sequence number of the letter
		in the alphabet:

		{A,B,C,...,Z} -> {1,2,3,...,26}

		{a,b,c,...,z} -> {1,2,3,...,26}

		Packing is 12 letters in each 64-bit word, with the
		left 4 bits set to zero followed by 5*12 = 60 bits of
		data.

		Length of dbc must be >= (dblen+11)/12 (64-bit words).


		mode = 6: Each input letter is assumed to be encoded using
		the 4-bit code described under mode=4 above. The result
		is the 2-bit code described under mode=2 above.

		Length of dbc must be >= (dblen+31)/32 (64-bit words).

NOTES
	cb_compress is single-threaded (i.e. not tasked) and may be called
	from within a parallel region. Before cb_compress is called in a
	parallel region with mode=4, it must have been previously called
	outside a parallel region with mode=4 to initialize internal tables.
	This initial call can be made with dblen=0.
