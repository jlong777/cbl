IMPLEMENTATION

        Version 1.1 for 32/64-bit big/little endian unix platforms.

DESCRIPTION

        Description for the original Cray cb_swa_fw:
        cb_swa_fw accepts two strings of ASCII characters, dbl and dbs,
        which nominally represent amino acids though the actual meaning
        is determined by the contents of the substitution score lookup
        table sslookup. The substitution scores and the extend gap penalty,
        eg, and the open gap penalty, og, are used to compute the Smith-Waterman
        aligment of the two strings.  This is performed in three steps,
        one step each for cb_swa_fw_init, cb_sw_fw_score, and cb_swa_fw_align.
        cb_swa_fw is a wrapper routine that calls these three routines and
        handles internal allocation and deallocation of work space.

        Description for the portable cb_swa_fw:
	The portable implementation of this routine is not a wrapper for 
	cb_swa_fw_init, cb_sw_fw_score, and cb_swa_fw_align, although code
	to do that is included in the source, but commented out. Instead,
	the portable version implements the Gotoh optimization of not storing
	the entire array of substitution scores (swtab). Traceback information
	is stored in 2 bits per cell. The function signature remains unchanged.

        cb_swa_fw_init accepts two strings, dbl and dbs, and a substitution
        score lookup table, sslookup, and fills the table swtab with the 
        substitution scores in rows and columns corresponding to the entries
        in the dbs and dbl strings. Row and column zero of the swtab are 
	initialized to zero.

        cb_sw_fw_score accepts the swtab, gaph, and gapv arrays created by
        cb_swa_fw_init, along with open gap and extend gap penalty values, and
        replaces the contents of swtab with the Smith-Waterman scores and 
        traceback information for each cell. It also returns the value in the 
        largest score in smax.

        cb_swa_fw_align accepts a completed Smith-Waterman score table as created
        by cb_sw_fw_score and a score, smax, contained in the table. It returns an 
        alignment that ends on a cell with the score value supplied. In cb_swa_fw 
        this score is the maximum score returned by cb_sw_fw_score.

        dbl     input string characters representing the longer of the two 
                sequences to be compared. For the cb_swa_* routines the
                input is ASCII characters, packed 8 per word.

        dbllen  input number of characters in dbl.

        dbs     input string characters representing the shorter of the two 
                sequences to be compared. For the cb_swa_* routines the
                input is ASCII characters, packed 8 per word.

        dbslen  input number of characters in dbs.

        eg      input score penalty for extending a gap. For cb_sw_fw_score,
                eg must be zero or positive.

        og      input score penalty for opening a gap. If eg and og are both
                non-zero, they should have the same sign. One gap is scored as 
		og + eg.

        eog     input combined gap open and gap extend penalty as a zero or
                positive integer.

        sslookup  input array containing the substitution matrix for the type of
                data represented by the input strings. sslookup[i][j] is the 
		substitution score for data entities represented by the i'th and 
		j'th letters of the alphabet equal to i and j. The declaration for 
		the array should be 
		
		long sslookup[27][32];

                Note that in the cb_swa_* case the leading size is 32 for 
                performance reasons on Cray hardware, even though only 26 
		entries are used. The entries in column and row zero are not 
		used. Entries must be defined for each letter combination that 
		might appear in the input strings.  The letter 'A' corresponds 
		to a subscript value of 1.

        smax    the largest cell score computed by cb_sw_fw_score.

        algl    an output array containing letters from dbl and "-" characters to 
                indicate gaps, corresponding to the alignment that ends at the
                location of the score smax in the score table. If the same 
                score appears more than once in the table, the one lowest and 
                rightmost in the table is used. The memory for algl is allocated 
		in cb_swa_fw_align. Algl should not be allocated before calling 
		either cb_swa_fw_align or cb_swa_fw.
                In C, deallocation of the memory associated with algl must be
                done with cb_free() to be portable on Cray hardware.

        algs    an output array similar to algl, but containing the alignment
                characters from the dbs string.

        algm    an output array similar to algl. algm contains a ":" character 
                in every location where the corresponding characters in algl
                and algs are the same (independent of case), and a " " (space)
                character where the corresponding characters in algl and algs 
                are different.

        alglen  output length, in characters, of the strings in algl, algs, and
                algm.

        algstl  output location in dbl corresponding to the first character in
                the algl array. The positions in dbl are numbered starting at 1.

        algsts  output location in dbs corresponding to the first character in
                the algs array. The positions in dbs are numbered starting at 1.
                
        errno   output error number.  If errno is 0, no error occurred.  If
                errno is non-zero, an error in memory allocation occurred.

        swtab   output (cb_swa_fw_init) or input (cb_sw_fw_score) table of 
                substitution scores as described above.
                output (cb_sw_fw_score) or input (cb_swa_fw_align) table of 
                Smith-Waterman cell scores. These are zero or positive by 
                construction, and are stored in the lower 60 bits (bits number 59-0) 
                of each word. The upper bits of the word are set as follows:

                bit 60 = 1 if score was computed as a horizontal gap extension
        
                bit 61 = 1 if score was computed as a vertical gap extension

                bit 62 = 1 if score was computed as a sequence extension from
                           the cell diagonally up and to the let.

                It is possible for more than one of the three bits to be set 
                if an equal score could be computed by more than one path.
                If the score is zero, bits 60-62 are all set to zero.

                C/C++ declaration: long swtab[dbllen+1][dbslen+1]

                The memory for swtab must be allocated before calling cb_swa_fw_init.
                swtab is allocated internally in cb_swa_fw.

        gaph    work array of (dbslen+1) elements used to hold accumulated gap 
                penalties in the horizontal direction. The memory for gaph must be 
		allocated before calling cb_sw*_fw_init. gaph is allocated 
		internaly in cb_swa_fw.

        gapv    work array of (dbslen+1) elements used to hold accumulated gap 
                penalties in the vertical direction. The memory for gapv must 
		be allocated before calling cb_sw*_fw_init. gapv is allocated 
		internaly in cb_swa_fw.


NOTES       

        For the cb_swa_fw and cb_swa_fw_init (ASCII input strings) routines,
        the expected format of the substitution matrix is alphabetical.  If the entries
        represent amino acids with the usual naming conventions, then the entries
        involving O and U are not used and can be set to any value.  The "*" character
        maps to the letter "J", which is otherwise not used. Entries corresponding to 
        "*" should be placed in the J row and column.

        cb_swa_fw, cb_swa_fw_init, cb_sw_fw_score, and cb_swa_fw_align are 
        single-threaded (i.e. not tasked) and may be called from within a parallel 
        region.
               
        Some of the Smith-Waterman routines dynamically allocate memory for the
        user supplied arguments.  If this memory is to be deallocated later, the
        deallocation must be done properly. In C, the variables must be deallocated 
	using cb_free() and not the C library free() function in order to be portable
	on Cray hardware.

        cb_swa_fw and cb_swa_fw_align relpace the contents of the bmm register 
	on Cray hardware.
