NAME
	cb_malloc - allocate block aligned memory region.

SYNOPSIS

	C/C++:

	#include &lt;<a href="cbl.html">cbl.h</a>&gt;
	void *cb_malloc(long nbytes);

IMPLEMENTATION

	Cray SV1 series UNICOS systems
	Dummy version for other 32/64-bit big/little endian unix platforms

DESCRIPTION

	In the portable version of this library for 32/64-bit big/little
	endian unix platforms, cb_malloc simply calls malloc. It is 
	included for portablility with Cray SV1 series UNICOS systems.
	
	On Cray SV1 series UNICOS systems, cb_malloc allocates memory
	using the Fortran allocate statement. On the SV1 this memory
	is aligned on 512 word address boundaries if the amount of
	memory requested is large. cb_malloc can be used to allocate
	memory appropriate for the cb_ssd_* routines. Memory allocated
	using cb_malloc must be deallocated using cb_free(), and not
	free(). cb_malloc returns a void pointer that should be cast
	to the appropriate data type, just as with malloc().

	nbytes	input number of bytes of memory to be allocated.

NOTES       
	cb_malloc is single-threaded (i.e. not tasked) but contains
	updates of internal data structures that are not thread safe.
	If cb_malloc is called from within a parallel region it should
	be done from within a protected region.

	cb_malloc is intended for C programmers only. In a Fortran
	program, arrays aligned arrays can be allocated using the
	allocate statement.
