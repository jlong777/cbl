NAME
	cb_searchn - gap-free nucleotide search allowing mismatches

SYNOPSIS

	C/C++:

	#include &lt;<a href="cbl.html">cbl.h</a>>
	void cb_searchn(long *db, long dblen, long *test, long testlen,
			long *found, long *foundlen, long threshold,
			long *count);

IMPLEMENTATION

	Version 1.0 for 32/64-bit big/little endian unix platforms.

DESCRIPTION

	cb_searchn returns locations in a database string of
	nucleotides that approximately match a test string of
	nucleotides. For each nucleotide starting location, N, in db
	between the beginning of db and testlen locations from the end
	of db, the subsequence in db of length testlen is compared to test.
	The number of corresponding positions in db and test where the
	nucleotides do not match, S, is computed. If S is &lt; or = threshold
	this alignment is considered a match and N is placed in the next
	free location of found, and S is placed in the corresponding
	location in count. The range of values for N is 0..dblen-testlen.
	The possible range of values for S is 0..threshold.

	db	input nucleotide data for database string, packed using
		2-bit compression (see cb_compress, mode=2).

	dblen	nput number of nucleotides packed into db.

	test	input nucleotide data for test string, packed using
		2-bit compression (see cb_compress, mode=2).

	testlen	input number of nucleotides packed into test.

	found	output list of starting locations in db where test matches
		as defined above. The first location of db is number 0.
		The memory for found must be allocated before calling
		cb_searchn.

	foundlen on input, size of found and count arrays
		 output number of valid entries in the found array. If the
		 number of matches found is larger that the size of the
		 found array, foundlen is returned as -(number found before
		 overflow). In this case, the trailing part of db will not
		 be searched. This should be treated as an error condition
		 by the caller.

	threshold input threshold number of differences that defines a
		  match. See description above.

	count	output number of differences between db and test for the
		substring of db as specified by the corresponding entry in
		the found array. The number of valid entries is foundlen
		if no error occurs. (See foundlen above.) The memory for
		count must be allocated before calling cb_searchn.

NOTES

	cb_searchn assumes dblen > testlen > 0 and
	threshold &lt; testlen; usually threshold &lt;&lt; testlen.

	If threshold is set to 0, cb_searchn returns only exact matches.

	If the test string length is &lt;= 32, a special algorithm is
	used which is faster and uses less memory bandwidth.

	cb_searchn is single-threaded (i.e. not tasked) and may be called
	from within a parallel region.
