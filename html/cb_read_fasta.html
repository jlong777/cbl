NAME

	cb_read_fasta - loads data from a FASTA file into memory arrays

SYNOPSIS

	C/C++:

	#include &lt;<a href="cbl.html">cbl.h</a>&gt;
	void cb_read_fasta(char *file, long lun, long **seq, long **hdr, 
                           ptrinfo **ptrs, long *nsegs, long *error);

IMPLEMENTATION

	Version 1.0 for 32/64-bit big/little endian unix platforms.

DESCRIPTION

	cb_read_fasta processes data from a file containing header lines
	and data lines of ASCII letters representing nucleotides or amino
	acids in the FASTA format. See the man page for cb_fasta_convert
	for more detail on the assumed file format.  cb_read_fasta
	transfers the file to memory as a single record, counts the number
	of header lines, allocates memory for the dat, hdr, and ptrs
	arrays, and moves the data and header information from the file
	image to the output arrays. The last step is done by a call to
	cb_fasta_convert.

	Each header line defines the beginning of a new block consisting
	of that header line and the subsequent data line(s) up to the next
	header line or the end of the image. The header line text is
	transferred to the hdr array and text from the associated data
	line(s) is transferred to the dat array. Pointers to the beginning
	of the text for each block, and the data text length are stored in
	the ptrs array.

	file	input name of the file to be read, a null terminated
		string with fewer than 1024 characters.

	lun	input value to be used as the Fortran unit number for the
		file open and read operations.  This number should be
		different from the unit numbers for any other currently
		open files. When using the proprietary CRAY version of
		this library, and the call to cb_read_fasta is in a parallel
		region, then each instance of the call should specify a
		different value for lun. In C, values of lun between 110 and
		2047 should avoid any internal library conflicts.
		(lun ignored in portable version)

	dat	output array holding the text of the data lines from the
		file. This array should be unallocated when cb_read_fasta
		is called. The memory for dat is allocated inside the
		routine. Each block of text data starts on a word boundary
		within dat. Each block is padded with zero bits if
		necessary to fill a multiple of 4 words in dat. The padding
		allows the entire dat array to be compressed using either 
		two or four bit compression and have the resulting blocks
		still word aligned. The starting location in dat of the
		data text for each block is specified by the datstart
		component of the ptrs structure for that block. The number
		of characters in the text, excluding any pad bits, is
		specified by the datleng component of the same ptrs
		structure.
		When using the proprietary CRAY version of this library,
		deallocating the memory for dat must be done with cb_free.
		See note below.

	hdr	output array holding the text of the header lines,
		including the "&gt;" characters, from the file. This array
		should be unallocated when cb_read_fasta is called. The
		memory for hdr is allocated inside the routine. If there
		is more than one block in the file, the header lines are
		concatenated together in hdr. The starting location in 
		hdr of the header text for each block is specified by the
		hdrstart component of the ptrs structure for that block. 
		When using the proprietary CRAY version of this library,
		deallocating the memory for hdr must be done with cb_free.
		See note below.

	ptrs	output array of structures that describe the locations in
		the dat and hdr arrays of the text associated with each
		block. The array should be unallocated when cb_read_fasta
		is called. The memory for ptrs is allocated inside the
		routine.

		The structure contains three values:

		hdrstart - character number in hdr where the header text
			   starts. The first location is hdrstart=1.

		datstart - word number in dat where the data text starts.
			   The first location is datstart=1.

		datleng  - number of characters in the data segment

                An additional structure is written at the end of the ptrs
                array.  This has the hdrstart element set to the location
                in the hdr array one past the end of the final header. This 
                provides a simple way for users to find the end of the
                final header.

		The typedef for ptrinfo is included in the <a href="cbl.html">cbl.h</a> header.
		When using the proprietary CRAY version of this library,
		deallocating the memory for ptrs must be done with cb_free.
		See note below.

	nsegs	output number of entries written to the ptrs array, equal
		to the number of header lines, and hence blocks, in the
		original file.

	error	output error indicator, set to 1 if an error occurred,
		and 0 otherwise.

NOTES       
	cb_read_fasta is single-threaded (i.e. not tasked) and may be
	called from within a parallel region. When using the proprietary
	CRAY version of this library, each parallel caller should specify
	a unique value for lun.

	Also when using the proprietary CRAY version of this library,
	note that cb_read_fasta allocates the output arrays dat, hdr,
	and ptrs, using the Fortan allocate statement. This provides
	automatic memory block alignment for large arrays. Memory
	allocated in this manner cannot be deallocated with the C free()
	function. The cb_free() function is supplied in this library to
	allow these arrays to be properly deallocated in a C function.
	See the man page for cb_free for details.
