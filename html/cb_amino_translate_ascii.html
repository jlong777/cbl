NAME

	cb_amino_translate_ascii - translate nucleotides to amino acids

SYNOPSIS

	C/C++:

	#include &lt;<a href="cbl.html">cbl.h</a>>
	void cb_amino_translate_ascii(long *db, long dblen,
				      long *am0, long *am1, long *am2);


IMPLEMENTATION

	Version 1.0 for 32/64-bit big/little endian unix platforms.

DESCRIPTION

	cb_amino_translate_ascii converts an input sequence of nucleotides
	into three sequences of amino acids, one for each reading frame.
	The input nucleotide sequence must be in the 2-bit compressed
	format. The output amino acids are represented by ASCII characters.
	Memory for the output arrays, am0, am1, and am3, must be allocated
	before calling cb_amino_translate_ascii, and must contain at least
	(dblen/3+7)/8 words each.

	db	(input) nucleotide sequnece in 2-bit compression format.
		See <a href="cb_compress.html">cb_compress</a> for details on compression.

	dblen	(input) number of nucleotide codes packed into db.

	am0	(output) sequence of amino acids translated from reading
		frame 0 of the input nucleotide sequence in db. Reading 
		rame 0 starts encoding at the first nucleotide in db.

	am1	(output) sequence of amino acids for reading frame 1.
		Reading frame 1 starts encoding with the second nucleotide
		in db.

	am2	(output) sequence of amino acids for reading frame 2.
		Reading frame 2 starts encoding with the third nucleotide
		in db.

NOTES

	cb_amino_translate_ascii translates nucleotides from the three
	reading frames in the forward direction. To get the other three
	reading frames from the reverse complement direction, create a
	reverse complement version of db using the cb_revcompl routine,
	and call cb_amino_translate_ascii a second time.

	cb_amino_translate_ascii is single-threaded (i.e. not tasked)
	and may be called from within a parallel region. If it is called
	in a parallel region, it must be called once prior to entering
	the parallel region to set up internal tables. This call can be
	made with dblen=0.
