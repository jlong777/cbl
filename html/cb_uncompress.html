NAME
	cb_uncompress - Convert compressed nucleotide or amino acid data
			to ASCII

SYNOPSIS

	C/C++:

	#include &lt;<a href="cbl.html">cbl.h</a>>
	void cb_uncompress(long *dbc, long *db, long dblen, long mode);

IMPLEMENTATION

	Version 1.0 for 32/64-bit big/little endian unix platforms.

DESCRIPTION

	cb_uncompress reverses the data compression performed by the
	cb_compress routine, converting compressed data into ASCII
	characters suitable for printing. The output array contains
	uppercase ASCII characters packed 8 per word. Because the
	compression for modes 2 and 4 converts more than one letter
	to a particular code, the process of compression followed by
	uncompression may not result in a replica of the original
	sequence.

	dbc	(input) packed codes. The number of bits/code and the
		amount of memory required depends on the mode value.

	db	(output) db contains ASCII text, packed 8 letters/word.
		Length of db is (dblen+7)/8 for 64-bit words, (dblen+3)/4 
		for 32-bit words. The final word may be filled with 
		trailing nulls. The db array must be allocated before 
		calling cb_uncompress.

	dblen	(input) Number of letters represented in db.

	mode	(input) Allowed values are 2, 4, and 5.

		mode = 2: Each 2-bit code sequence is converted to
		ASCII as follows:

		00 -> A

		01 -> C

		10 -> T

		11 -> G


		mode = 4: Each 4-bit code sequence is converted to
		ASCII as follows:

		1000 -> A
		0100 -> C
		0010 -> G
		0001 -> T
		0111 -> B
		1011 -> D
		1101 -> H
		0011 -> K
		1100 -> M
		1111 -> N
		1010 -> R
		0110 -> S
		1110 -> V
		1001 -> W
		0101 -> Y


		mode = 5: Each 5-bit code sequence represents an integer
		which is converted to an ASCII letter as follows:

		{1,2,3,...,26} -> {A,B,C,...,Z}

		Packing in dbc is 12 letters in each 64-bit word, with the
		left 4 bits set to zero followed by 5*12 = 60 bits of
		data.

NOTES
	cb_uncompress is single-threaded (i.e. not tasked) and may be
	called from within a parallel region.
