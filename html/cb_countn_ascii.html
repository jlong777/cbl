NAME
	cb_countn_ascii - counts A, C, T, G, and N characters in a string

SYNOPSIS

	C/C++:

	#include &lt;<a href="cbl.html">cbl.h</a>>
	void cb_countn_ascii(long *dba, long dblen, long res[]);

IMPLEMENTATION

	Version 1.0 for 32/64-bit big/little endian unix platforms.

DESCRIPTION

	cb_countn_ascii counts the number of occurrences of the letters
	A, C, T, G, and N in a string containing ASCII letters. Lower
	case letters are treated as equivalent to the corresponding upper
	case letters, and are included in the counts. The number of
	letters not included in the set of five counted can be obtained
	by subtracting the sum of the five results from dblen.

	dba	(input) sequence of ASCII letters packed 8/word with
		possible null characters in the end of the final word.

	dblen	(input) number of nucleotides packed into dba.

	res	(output) array of at least 5 elements containing the
		counts of the common nucleotide codes as follows:

		res[0] = number of A and a characters in dba.
		res[1] = number of C and c characters in dba.
		res[2] = number of T and t characters in dba.
		res[3] = number of G and g characters in dba.
		res[4] = number of N and n characters in dba.

		Memory for res must be allocated before calling
		cb_countn_ascii.

NOTES

	cb_countn_ascii provides a quick way to profile a set of
	nucleotide data to determine how many ambiguous codes are
	present, and also to check for a relative excess or deficiency
	of C/G letters.

	cb_countn_ascii is single-threaded (i.e. not tasked) and may be
	called from within a parallel region.
