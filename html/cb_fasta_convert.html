NAME

	cb_fasta_convert - restructure the memory image of a FASTA format 
			   file

SYNOPSIS

	C/C++:

	#include &lt;<a href="cbl.html">cbl.h</a>&gt;
	void cb_fasta_convert(long *db, long dblen, long *dat, long datlen,
                              long *hdr, long hdrlen, ptrinfo *ptrs,
                              long ptrslen, long *nsegs, long *errno);

IMPLEMENTATION

	Version 1.0 for 32/64-bit big/little endian unix platforms.

DESCRIPTION

	cb_fasta_convert extracts and organizes data contained in a memory
	image of a FASTA style data file.  The image is assumed to be
	composed of lines consisting of ASCII characters terminated be a
	newline character with the decimal value of 10. The image contains
	two types of lines, header lines and data lines. Header lines are
	distinguished by having "&gt;" as the first character of the line.
	This memory image may be created by transferring an entire
	external file as a single unformatted binary record from disk to
	memory. Thus, the usual character based read operations are
	replaced by a combination of a binary read and formatting done by
	cb_fasta_convert. This two step process is significantly faster,
	especially for large files.

	Each header line defines the beginning of a new block consisting
	of that header line and the subsequent data line(s) up to the next
	header line or the end of the image. The header line text is
	transferred to the hdr array and text from the associated data
	line(s) is transferred to the dat array. Pointers to the beginning
	of the text for each block, and the data text length are stored in
	the ptrs array.

	db	input memory image to be reformatted. db should be an
		array of length (dblen+7)/8 for 64-bit machine.

	dblen	input number of characters in the db array.

	dat	output array holding the text of the data lines, excluding
		the trailing newline characters. Each block starts on a
		word boundary within dat. Each block is padded with zero
		bits if necessary to fill a multiple of 4 words in dat.
		The padding allows the entire dat array to be compressed
		using either two or four bit compression and have the
		resulting blocks still word aligned. The starting location
		in dat of the data text for each block is specified by the
		datstart component of the ptrs structure for that block.
		The number of characters in the text, excluding any pad
		bits, is specified by the datleng component of the same
		ptrs structure. The memory for dat must be allocated before
		calling cb_fasta_convert. dat should be an array of length
		(datlen+7)/8 for 64-bit machine.

	datlen	input allocated size of the dat array in units of characters.

	hdr	output array holding the text of the header lines,
		including the "&gt;" characters but excluding the trailing
		newline characters, concatenated together. The starting
		location in hdr of the header text for each block is
		specified by the hdrstart component of the ptrs structure
		for that block. The memory for hdr must be allocated
		before calling cb_fasta_convert. hdr should be declared 
		as an array of length (hdrlen+7)/8 for 64-bit machine.

	hdrlen	input allocated size of the hdr array in units of characters.

	ptrs	output array of structures that describe the locations in
		the dat and hdr arrays of the text associated with each
		block. The memory for ptrs must be allocated before calling
		cb_fasta_convert. The structure contains three values:

		hdrstart - character number in hdr where the header text
			   starts. The first location is hdrstart=1.

		datstart - word number in dat where the data text starts.
			   The first location is datstart=1.

		datleng  - number of characters in the data segment

		An additional structure is written at the end of the ptrs
		array.  This has the hdrstart element set to the location
                in the hdr array one past the end of the final header.
		This provides a simple way for users to find the end of
		the final header.

		The typedef for prtinfo is supplied in the <a href="cbl.html">cbl.h</a> header.

	ptrslen	input indicating that the allocated size of the ptrs array
		is 3*ptrslen long words, or 24*ptrslen bytes. ptrslen
		specifies the allocated length of the prts array. This
		value needs to be at least one greater than the total
		number of data blocks in the db array.

	nsegs	output number of actual entries written to the ptrs array,
		equal to the number of header lines, and hence blocks, in
		the original file.

	errno	output error status set to one of these values:

		0 - no error
		1 - not enough space in dat array
		2 - not enough space in hdr array
		3 - not enough space in ptrs array
		4 - not enough space for the final ptrs array element

		If errno is returned with a non-zero value, the data in db
		was not completely processed.

NOTES       
	cb_fasta_convert is single-threaded (i.e. not tasked) and may be
	called from within a parallel region.

	A wrapper routine, cb_read_fasta, is available that combines the
	file I/O, memory allocations, and reformatting using
	cb_fasta_convert.
